You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:

<!-- Write your comments here -->
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- Comments are not displayed in the browser -->

</body>
</html>
