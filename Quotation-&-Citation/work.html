HTML <cite> for Work Title
The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).

Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.

The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>The HTML cite element defines the title of a work.</p>
<p>Browsers usually display cite elements in italic.</p>
