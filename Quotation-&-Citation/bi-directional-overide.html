BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.

The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:
  
  
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>If your browser supports bi-directional override (bdo), the next line will be written from right to left (rtl):</p>

<bdo dir="rtl">This line will be written from right to left</bdo>

</body>
</html>
